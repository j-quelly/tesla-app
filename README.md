# Tesla Code Challenge
Thank you for your interest in my candidacy.  Please note the following:

1. The /dist/ folder is only to demonstrate a production ready application.  To improve upon this I could have used the task runner to vet my css and js and employed TDD, FOUC techniques, animations, and utilized a style guide.  Feel free to check out the Gruntfile to see the build process.
2. The cleanup.js is just a small utility I developed for removing the /node_modules/ folder on Windows 7.  I've removed the folder to make the .zip smaller.
3. To get started simply follow the instructions below.  I hope you enjoy!

## Getting Started
1. ```npm install```
2. ```npm start```

## Alternative Usage
```grunt serve-dev```
